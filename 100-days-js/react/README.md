# 100 Days of Code

> 🎯"Consistency beats intensity." 

This repository documents my **100 Days of Code** journey focused on mastering JavaScript, starting with React.js and progressing to Node.js. My goal is to move beyond surface-level tutorials toward in-depth mastery and production-grade engineering.

## 🧭 Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: Foundations (Days 1–10)
* **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Scopes, closures, and the execution context.
* **ES6+ Features:** Let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, and modules.
* **Async JavaScript:** Callbacks, promises, and `async/await`.
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub professional workflows.

### Phase 2: React.js Mastery (Days 11–60)
* **Core Concepts:** JSX, components, props, and state management.
* **Advanced Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useMemo`.
* **Architecture:** Component patterns and composition.
* **Forms & Logic:** Validation and controlled vs. uncontrolled inputs.
* **Ecosystem:** * Routing with React Router.
    * API Integration (REST).
    * State Management (Context API $\rightarrow$ Redux).
* **Optimization:** Performance tuning and memoization.
* **Testing:** Unit and integration testing with Jest and React Testing Library.
* **Milestone:** Mini-projects leading to 1 major capstone React project.

### Phase 3: Node.js Mastery (Days 61–95)
* **Node.js Core:** Fundamentals and the Event Loop.
* **Web Frameworks:** Express.js and middleware architecture.
* **API Design:** RESTful principles and error handling.
* **Security:** Authentication & Authorization via JWT.
* **Databases:** Integration with MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
* **Advanced Backend:** File uploads, background jobs, and security best practices.
* **Testing:** API testing with Postman and Supertest.

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Days 96–100)
* **Full-Stack:** Integrating React frontends with Node.js backends.
* **DevOps:** Deployment (Docker) and basic CI/CD.
* **Review:** Final documentation, cleanup, and retrospective.

## 📅 Daily Commitment

* **Time:** Minimum 1 hour/day.
* **Rule:** Code every day (No zero days).
* **Focus:** Learn $\rightarrow$ Build $\rightarrow$ Reflect.

**Each day includes:**
- [x] **What I learned**
- [x] **What I built**
- [x] **Key takeaways**

## 📌 Rules of the Challenge
Daily Coding: Code for 100 consecutive days.

Version Control: Push code daily (even small commits).

No Blind Copying: No copy-paste without a deep understanding of the logic.

Practical Application: Build more than you watch; prioritize projects over tutorials.

Documentation: Write notes and reflections in your own words.

## 🎯 Final Outcome
By the end of this challenge, I aim to:

Be confident in building production-ready React.js applications.

Design and deploy secure, scalable Node.js APIs.

Ship at least 3 solid portfolio projects.

Develop a permanent daily coding habit.
