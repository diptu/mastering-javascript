      <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.

        It follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken into reusable, independent components.

        React uses a Virtual DOM, which:

        Improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation

        Efficiently updates only the parts of the UI that change</p>
    </>

  );

export default App;
